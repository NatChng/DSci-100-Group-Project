# DSci-100-Group-Project

## Welcome!

This repo is based on a final group project that I worked on as part of an Introduction to Data Science (DSCI 100) class I was enrolled in during 2022 Summer. Shoutout to the other members of Project Group 9: Alexandra (@FeyreAch3ron), Mirren (@MirrenB), and Marium, for their contributions!

The goal of this project is to work through a basic machine learning problem using concepts demonstrated in class, while using Git and GitHub to faacilitate collaboration. We used data obtained from <i> User Knowledge Modeling Data Set</i> (Kahraman et al., 2013) to determine if student exam scores can be accurately predicted using a student's knowledge level, performance on related exams, and study time, as well as which predictors yield the most accurate model.
